CVEQ v0.1 â€” Computational Velocity Equivalence Standard

Overview

CVEQ (Computational Velocity Equivalence) is a universal benchmarking standard designed to represent real-world computing power in a human-friendly, scalable, and cross-platform metric. Similar to "horsepower" in engines, CVEQ allows for quick, relatable comparisons of computational capability across smartphones, laptops, desktops, and servers.

Core Principle

CVEQ measures a system's computational velocityâ€”its ability to turn inputs into real, useful outputs across a spectrum of modern tasks. The scale is normalized to real, affordable devices rather than theoretical maximums or lab benchmarks.

CVEQ Baseline Units

âœ¨ CVEQ 1.0 (Laptop Reference Unit)

Device: 2015 MacBook Pro (13")

Specs:

Intel i5/i7 dual-core @ 2.7â€“3.3 GHz

8GB RAM

Integrated Iris GPU

PCIe SSD (500MB/s+)

Use Case: Midline laptop performance for creative, technical, and productivity workloads

ðŸ“± Phone Class

Example: iPhone 9 / iPhone SE (2020)

CVEQ: ~0.25

Notes: Efficient for mobile AI and basic productivity. Thermal throttling limits sustained compute. Not comparable to desktop-class systems over time.

ðŸš€ Server Class

Example: $7,500 2018 rackmount server

Specs: Dual Xeon or AMD EPYC, 256+GB RAM, high-throughput SSD/NVMe, redundant PSU

CVEQ: ~10.0 to 12.0

Notes: Modular, long lifecycle. Used in data centers, scientific computing, and AI inferencing.

Extended Metrics

To support broad adoption, CVEQ includes derivative metrics:

CVEQ/Watt: Energy efficiency for sustainability tracking

CVEQ/$: Consumer value-to-performance

CVEQ-Year: Historical compute velocity curve (e.g. CVEQ of Pentium 4 ~0.05)

CVEQ-Latency: Response time-to-output across real-world workloads

Use Cases

News reports: "This datacenter runs at 50,000,000 CVEQs of compute."

Military logistics: "Each field unit has 12,000 CVEQs embedded."

Consumer protection: "This $1,400 phone offers only 0.4 CVEQ."

Cloud pricing: "Amazon EC2 CVEQ/hour pricing for transparency."
