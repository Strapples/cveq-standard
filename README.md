CVEQ v0.1 — Computational Velocity Equivalence Standard

Overview

CVEQ (Computational Velocity Equivalence) is a universal benchmarking standard designed to represent real-world computing power in a human-friendly, scalable, and cross-platform metric. Similar to "horsepower" in engines, CVEQ allows for quick, relatable comparisons of computational capability across smartphones, laptops, desktops, and servers.

Core Principle

CVEQ measures a system's computational velocity—its ability to turn inputs into real, useful outputs across a spectrum of modern tasks. The scale is normalized to real, affordable devices rather than theoretical maximums or lab benchmarks.

CVEQ Baseline Units

✨ CVEQ 1.0 (Laptop Reference Unit)

Device: 2015 MacBook Pro (13")

Specs:

Intel i5/i7 dual-core @ 2.7–3.3 GHz

8GB RAM

Integrated Iris GPU

PCIe SSD (500MB/s+)

Use Case: Midline laptop performance for creative, technical, and productivity workloads

💻 CVEQ 2.5 (Workstation Laptop - High Grade)

Device: Apple M4 Pro MacBook (2024)

Specs:

Apple M4 Pro SoC

12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, 36GB RAM

High-bandwidth SSD (~5000MB/s)

16-core Neural Engine

Use Case: Workstation-grade mobile computing. Ideal for ML, video editing, engineering, and real-time applications.

🖥️ CVEQ ~4.5 (High Grade Workstation Desktop)

Device: $2,000 custom-built desktop (2024 market equivalent)

Specs:

AMD Ryzen 9 / Intel i9 (12–16 cores)

32–64GB RAM

RTX 4080 / Radeon 7900 class GPU

NVMe SSD (7000MB/s+)

Use Case: Advanced rendering, scientific simulations, AI training workloads. Highly thermally sustained.

📱 Phone Class

Example: iPhone 9 / iPhone SE (2020)

CVEQ: ~0.25

Notes: Efficient for mobile AI and basic productivity. Thermal throttling limits sustained compute. Not comparable to desktop-class systems over time.

🚀 Server Class

Example: $7,500 2018 rackmount server

Specs: Dual Xeon or AMD EPYC, 256+GB RAM, high-throughput SSD/NVMe, redundant PSU

CVEQ: ~10.0 to 12.0

Notes: Modular, long lifecycle. Used in data centers, scientific computing, and AI inferencing.

Extended Metrics

To support broad adoption, CVEQ includes derivative metrics:

CVEQ/Watt: Energy efficiency for sustainability tracking

CVEQ/$: Consumer value-to-performance

CVEQ-Year: Historical compute velocity curve (e.g. CVEQ of Pentium 4 ~0.05)

CVEQ-Latency: Response time-to-output across real-world workloads

Macroscale Metrics

nCVEQ Core (Current Scores)

Computed based on publicly known High Performance Cluster (HPC) metrics, such as government, university, and institutional compute nodes. Core scores do not include consumer, mobile, or private infrastructure.

nCVEQ Extended (Planned)

Future versions of nCVEQ will include estimates from consumer and mobile devices, using data from sources like Nielsen, telecom analytics, and computing usage statistics to generate extended national CVEQ footprints.

Use Cases

News reports: "This datacenter runs at 50,000,000 CVEQs of compute."

Military logistics: "Each field unit has 12,000 CVEQs embedded."

Consumer protection: "This $1,400 phone offers only 0.4 CVEQ."

Cloud pricing: "Amazon EC2 CVEQ/hour pricing for transparency."

License & Governance

CVEQ is released under the MIT License and intended as an open standard for global use. Anyone may contribute CVEQ mappings, benchmark plugins, or integration tools.
